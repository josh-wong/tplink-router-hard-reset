# 2 - Getting started
Before you perform a hard reset on your TP-Link router, confirm that you do not have Wi-Fi connection on multiple devices. For example:

- If only one device doesn't cannot connect to Wi-Fi, the problem may be based on the device instead of the router.
- If none of your devices can connect to Wi-Fi, the problem is likely with the router. In this case, please proceed with the following if you have exhausted all other troubleshooting methods.

## Prerequisites
You will need access to the following when performing the hard reset on the router:

- Desktop or laptop PC with an ethernet port (or USB-to-ethernet adapter)
- Ethernet cable
- Modem
- Router
- Small pin
